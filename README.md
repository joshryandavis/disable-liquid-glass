# disable-liquid-glass

I don't mind liquid glass, personally.

But this is useful if you want to try out other Tahoe features without the UI being so slow/resource-intensive.

You must have SIP disabled. Do this at your own risk.

(If you don't know what SIP is or how to disable it, then you shouldn't be using this script.)


## Usage

```
sudo ./liquid-glass.sh [enable|disable]
```

Then reboot.
